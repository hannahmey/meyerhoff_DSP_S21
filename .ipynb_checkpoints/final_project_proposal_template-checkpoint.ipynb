(I also have a lot of demographic variables (e.g. financial status, education, civil status, living situation etc.), but I excluded those for this dataset because I think it's getting to big then. But if you think it makes sense, I can include them as well and maybe make a compare models with preganncy related variables and sociodemographic varaibles and look which models explain more variance etc.) \n",

Therefore I use a part of my data as the training dataset and the rest as the test dataset. I also want to see, if my dependet variables correlate with each other. Since I don't know which predictors have an influence on the dependet variables, I have a lot of independet variables (26).\n",
